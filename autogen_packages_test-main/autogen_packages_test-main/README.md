A simple test checking how to make AutoGen Agents install required packages on their own.

To set this up:

1. Install Docker Desktop if you haven't already
2. Make it use WSL as its backend
3. Create a .venv using PyCharm or similar software
4. Install dependencies in requirements.txt
5. Replace the API key in config.json with your own
6. Test the code
